# Scraping Project

A company contacted me to scrape product details from a website and store all the information in an Excel sheet. 
I had to collect the product image link, the product description, the price, and other properties. 
The company gave me an Excel file containing all the links related to the products. 
I simply wrote a code that iterate on that list of links and perform the same scraping function on them.
